<h1>Combined Meaning:</h1>
<br />
<p>An engineering student is defined as an individual pursuing education in engineering or engineering technology, focusing on excellence in instruction, research, and technological education to contribute to society.</p>
<p>Engineering, like the physical sciences, relies heavily on journal articles and, to a much lesser extent, on books. The field is different from many others, though, in the heavy use of conference proceedings as an information source. Students must be comfortable citing both print and online conference papers, as well as papers presented but not published. Additionally, technical reports, standards, patents, and product information are frequently cited in engineering and students need to be competent in incorporating citations to these material types in their work. Use of other information sources tends to vary depending on the sub-field of engineering under consideration: for example, computer engineering will rely more heavily on software code than other areas, while chemical engineers are more likely to use sources like Material Data Safety Sheets (MSDS). Ideally, citation instruction will be tailored to studentsâ€™ specific sub-discipline within engineering.</p>
